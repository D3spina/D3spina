# Welcome !

## About me

Hello, I'm Guillaume! After a successful 10-year career in insurance sales, I've embarked on a new journey in the tech world, specializing in IT project management and cybersecurity. I'm currently enrolled in the MSc pro program at Epitech, where I'm honing my skills in cybersecurity and network management.

I'm passionate about using technology to solve complex problems and protect digital assets from emerging cyber threats. This GitHub page serves as a portfolio of my projects, both academic and personal, showcasing my journey through the world of tech.

## My projects

Here you'll find a variety of projects ranging from small scripts aimed at automating mundane tasks to larger, more complex systems designed to enhance cybersecurity measures. My projects are a reflection of my learning journey and my commitment to developing practical, impactful tech solutions.

### Personal Projects

- RedHive (The project is not public at this time)
  An infrastructure monitoring system that collects software and system data from endpoints, identifies vulnerabilities, and automatically attempts non-destructive exploitation to       confirm them. The results, including vulnerability details and confirmed exploits, are visualized in real-time through Grafana dashboards using Elasticsearch as the backend.
  
- [Basic-Linux-Privilege-Escalation-Audit](https://github.com/D3spina/Basic-Linux-Privilege-Escalation-Audit)  
  Script to check whether the system configuration allows privilege escalation.

- [Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate](https://github.com/D3spina/Google-Cybersecurity-Professional-Certificate/tree/main)  
  Work completed during the certification process (Python, SQL, Splunk, etc.).
